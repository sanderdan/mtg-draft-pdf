    <h1>Mechanics</h1>
		<div class="mechanics">
			<div class="mechanic">
				<h2>Rooms</h2>
				<span>Enchantment - Room (You may cast either half. That door unlocks on the battlefield. As a sorcery, you may pay the mana cost of a locked door to unlock it.)</span>
			</div>
			<div class="mechanic">
				<h2>Umbra Armor</h2>
				<span>Former: "Totem Armor". Umbra armor appears on Aura cards. If a
					creature enchanted by an Aura with umbra armor would be destroyed,
					instead that Aura is destroyed and all damage dealt to the creature
					is removed.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="mechanic">
				<h2>Impending</h2>
				<span>Impending [X] — (If you cast this spell for its impending cost, it enters with [X] time counters and isn't a creature until the last is removed. At the beginning of your end step, remove a time counter from it.)
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="mechanic">
				<h2>Manifest Dread</h2>
				<span>(Look at the top two cards of your library. Put one onto the battlefield face down as a 2/2 creature and the other into your graveyard. Turn it face up any time for its mana cost if it's a creature card.)</span>
			</div>
			<div class="mechanic">
				<h2>Survival</h2>
				<span>Survival — At the beginning of your second main phase, if [CARNDAME] is tapped, you gain 2 life.</span>
			</div>
      <div class="mechanic">
				<h2>Eerie</h2>
				<span>Eerie — Whenever an enchantment you control enters and whenever you fully unlock a Room, put a +1/+1 counter on target creature.</span>
